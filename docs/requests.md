# Requests

New content requests are handled through Plex's native Watchlist system. Simply add movies or tv shows to your Watchlist inside of Plex and they will be added to the system shortly thereafter.

## Requirements

You need to have your Watchlist set to at least "Friends Only" and not "Private".
